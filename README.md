# Basic Secure Banking System (C++)

Welcome to the Basic Secure Banking System project! This is a simple, yet secure, banking system code implemented in C++. As a beginner's project, it's a great starting point for learning C++ and exploring basic software security concepts.

## About

This project serves two primary purposes:
1. **Learning**: This is my first C++ program, and it's aimed at beginners who are eager to understand how to implement basic features and security measures in C++.

2. **Bug Hunt**: I'm inviting users to find and report any bugs or vulnerabilities in the code. It's a fun exercise for those who enjoy exploring and testing C++ code for potential issues.

## Features

### Input Validation

- The code includes robust input validation to ensure that user inputs are properly checked for correctness.
- It handles a variety of scenarios, including non-integer input, out-of-range values, and non-whole numbers.
- Users are encouraged to test the input validation thoroughly and report any issues.

### Logical Error Proof

- Care has been taken to minimize logical errors in the code, ensuring that the banking operations work as expected.
- Logical errors that could lead to incorrect balances or unexpected behavior have been addressed.
- Users are encouraged to explore the code and report any logical errors they may discover.

## Bug Hunt

I invite you to participate in the bug hunt! If you love to explore C++ code and discover potential vulnerabilities or issues, this project is for you. Here's how you can get involved:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Examine the code, especially the input validation and logic related to banking operations.

3. Test the code thoroughly and try different scenarios to identify potential bugs.

4. If you find any issues, please report them on [telegram](https://t.me/ieatkidsforlunch). Your feedback is valuable!

5. As a token of appreciation for your efforts, I'll award a digital cake (for fun, not a serious reward) for every valid bug report.

## Contribution

If you'd like to contribute to the project by improving the code, adding features, or enhancing security, feel free to create pull requests. I welcome contributions from both beginners and experienced developers.

## Disclaimer

This project is intended for learning purposes and as a fun bug hunting task. It is not meant for production use and should not be used for actual banking operations. Please use responsible and ethical practices when exploring code and reporting bugs.

Happy coding and happy bug hunting!
